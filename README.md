# SR_Latch
It describes the design, simulation, and analysis of an SR latch in 45nm CMOS technology, concentrating on its pre-layout and post-layout performance. The SR latch which is the basic memory circuit is built using two NMOS and PMOS cross-coupled NAN gates. Design includes schematic, pre-layout simulation, layout design and post layout simulation. Functional checks are carried out in the form of Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) verifications. The results indicate a noteworthy post layout performance drop where static and dynamic power dissipation increases and rise, fall and delay times lengthen due to layout introduced parasitic effects. These results contribute towards the understanding of the effects of parasitic elements on the power and timing performance of the circuit and advocate for the integration of layout optimization techniques towards improved efficiency in practical use.
